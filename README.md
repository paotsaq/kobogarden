# Kobo highlight handler (for TiddlyWiki purposes)

I've been reading digitally for many years, and it is my preferred medium for tackling non-fiction. Of course, I take lots of bookmarks and notes (using the built-in tools on the devices), but it feels pointless if there is no further integration in a centralised knowledge based I could later access those in. Since I use [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com), it felt natural to create tiddlers out of book quotes.
